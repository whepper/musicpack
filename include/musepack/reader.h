/// \file reader.h

/// The decoder consumes raw stream bytes exclusively through the
/// \ref mpc_reader interface below. A reader is a set of callbacks plus a
/// caller-owned context pointer (`data`). The decoder never owns the reader
/// and never copies input into its own buffering policy beyond what the
/// demuxer requires internally.
///
/// Sources are pluggable:
///
///     FILE *
///     memory buffer          ->  mpc_reader_init_memory()
///     HTTP Range / custom    ->  implement the callbacks yourself

/// # Implementing a custom reader
///
/// Fill an `mpc_reader` and point `data` at your context:

///     struct my_ctx { ... };
///     static mpc_int32_t my_read(mpc_reader *r, void *ptr, mpc_int32_t n) {
///         struct my_ctx *c = (struct my_ctx *) r->data;
///         ...
///     }
///     static mpc_bool_t my_seek(mpc_reader *r, mpc_seek_t off) { ... }
///     static mpc_seek_t my_tell(mpc_reader *r) { ... }
///     static mpc_seek_t my_size(mpc_reader *r) { ... }
///     static mpc_bool_t my_canseek(mpc_reader *r) { ... }
///
///     mpc_reader reader = { my_read, my_seek, my_tell, my_size, my_canseek, ctx };
///
/// `read` returns the number of bytes actually read (0 at end of input).
/// `seek` returns MPC_TRUE on success. `get_size` returns 0 if unknown.
/// Non-seekable sources must return MPC_FALSE from `canseek`; seeking
/// operations on such a source fail cleanly with MUSEPACK_ERR_SEEK.
///
/// # Memory adapter ownership

/// # Reader contract
///
///  - `read` returns the number of bytes actually read and 0 only at the end
///    of available input. Short reads are treated as end-of-available-data by
///    the decoder. Readers that cannot signal a transport error in-band
///    should return 0 on failure; the decoder then reports the stream as
///    truncated (MUSEPACK_ERR_INVALID).
///  - `seek`/`tell`/`get_size` use 64-bit `mpc_seek_t` positions, safe for
///    files and slices larger than 4 GiB.
///  - `get_size` returns 0 when the total size is unknown (e.g. a live
///    stream). Such a reader should also return MPC_FALSE from `canseek`.
///  - `canseek` must return MPC_FALSE for non-seekable sources (network
///    sockets without Range support, pipes). Seeking then fails cleanly with
///    MUSEPACK_ERR_SEEK.
///  - All callbacks receive the reader's `data` pointer, so a custom source
///    (HTTP Range stream, `.mpack` AU slice, browser fetch buffer, iOS/
///    Android networking) carries its state there. The decoder never touches
///    `data` beyond passing it through.
///
/// # Adapter ownership
///
///  - mpc_reader_init_stdio() opens and owns the FILE*; the file is closed by
///    mpc_reader_exit_stdio().
///  - mpc_reader_init_stdio_stream() borrows the caller's FILE*, but the
///    adapter still closes it on exit. Do not fclose() it yourself.
///  - mpc_reader_init_memory() borrows the caller's buffer: the buffer must
///    outlive the reader (and any decoder opened on it). The adapter frees
///    only its own bookkeeping structure on mpc_reader_exit_memory().

/// Initializes a reader over a caller-owned memory buffer.
