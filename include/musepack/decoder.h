/// \file decoder.h
/// Stable decoder-facing API for libmusepack.
///
/// This is the canonical C interface that the WebAssembly wrapper, future
/// Swift (iOS) and JNI (Android) wrappers, and all MusicPack components
/// consume. It is intentionally small, opaque and single-threaded.
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
///     mpc_reader            reader;                 // caller-owned
///     mpc_reader_init_stdio(&reader, "song.mpc");
///
///     musepack_error err;
///     musepack_decoder *d = musepack_decoder_open(&reader, &err);
///     if (!d) { ... }
///
///     musepack_stream_info info;
///     info.size = sizeof(info);
///     musepack_decoder_get_stream_info(d, &info);
///
///     float pcm[MUSEPACK_FRAME_MAX * 2];
///     uint64_t n;
///     while (musepack_decoder_read(d, pcm, MUSEPACK_FRAME_MAX, &n) == MUSEPACK_OK) {
///         // interleaved float PCM, n sample-frames
///     }
///
///     musepack_decoder_close(d);
///     mpc_reader_exit_stdio(&reader);
///
/// # Ownership rules
///
///  - The caller owns the reader. The decoder borrows it for its lifetime
///    and never frees it (or its `data`). Keep the reader alive until after
///    musepack_decoder_close().
///  - musepack_decoder_close() may be passed NULL (it is a no-op). Calling
///    close() twice on the same decoder, or using a decoder after close(),
///    is undefined behaviour.
///  - musepack_decoder_open() parses the header immediately and fails
///    (returning NULL) on unreadable or invalid input. Opening consumes
///    header bytes from the reader, so the reader's position after open is
///    unspecified. A reader may be reused for a later decoder only after it
///    has been repositioned to the stream start.
///  - create/open/decode/seek/close may be repeated any number of times on
///    fresh readers; each decoder is fully independent.
///
/// # Error handling
///
/// Every call that can fail reports a \ref musepack_error. Errors are
/// negative; MUSEPACK_OK (0) means success. A failed read/seek does not
/// invalidate the decoder; the call may be retried. Error codes actually
/// produced by the current decoder:
///
///  - MUSEPACK_ERR_INVALID — open (unreadable/unsupported stream), read and
///    check_stream (malformed or truncated data), bad arguments.
///  - MUSEPACK_ERR_NOMEM — open (allocation failure).
///  - MUSEPACK_ERR_SEEK — seek on a non-seekable reader or a failed seek.
///  - MUSEPACK_ERR_EOF — end of stream (read only).
///  - MUSEPACK_ERR_IO is reserved for future readers that can distinguish
///    transport failures; the current decoder reports such conditions as
///    MUSEPACK_ERR_INVALID.
///
/// # Thread-safety contract
///
/// No explicit library initialization is required; tables are built once on
/// first use. Distinct decoder instances (each with its own reader) may be
/// used concurrently from different threads. A single decoder instance and
/// its reader are not thread-safe and must not be shared without external
/// locking; a reader must not be shared between decoders on different
/// threads.
