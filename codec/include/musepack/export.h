///  - ELF/Mach-O shared builds keep internal symbols hidden (the library is
///    compiled with -fvisibility=hidden and only these macros re-export the
///    public surface).

/// MUSEPACK_BUILD_SHARED is defined only when compiling the shared library
/// itself. MUSEPACK_USE_SHARED is defined on the consuming side by the
