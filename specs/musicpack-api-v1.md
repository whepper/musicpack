# MusicPack HTTP API v1

This document is the human-readable specification for the MusicPack server's
HTTP API (`musicpack-server`). API versioning is **independent** of `.mpack`
manifest versioning (`specs/musicpack-v1.md`).

Status: **v1** (Phase 6). Read-only library API behind bearer-token or
session-cookie authentication, with live scan/verify operations and the
browser-session layer for the first-party web client.

## 0. Authentication

All `/api/v1/*` endpoints require credentials **except** `GET
/api/v1/health` (liveness) and the session create/logout routes.

```http
Authorization: Bearer mpk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

- Tokens are opaque, 256-bit random secrets (`mpk_` + base64url), shown once
  at creation. Only their SHA-256 is stored server-side; they are verified by
  hash lookup with constant-time comparison.
- Missing/malformed credentials → `401 unauthorized`.
- A revoked or expired token → `401 unauthorized` (single privilege class;
  `403` is reserved and used for disallowed CORS origins).
- Tokens are managed with the CLI:
  `musicpack-server token create --name "Web" | token list | token revoke <id>`.
- Bearer tokens remain the API surface for CLI/native clients. The first-party
  web client authenticates once with a bearer token and then uses an
  **HttpOnly session cookie** (see §0.2).

### 0.1 CORS

Restrictive by default. No `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`; when
authentication is involved, CORS is granted only to origins explicitly listed
with `--allow-origin URL` (repeatable).

- A request with an `Origin` header not in the allow-list → `403
  origin_forbidden`.
- `OPTIONS` preflight for an allowed origin → `204` with
  `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS` and
  `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type`.
- Same-origin and no-Origin clients are unaffected.

## 0.2 Sessions (browser cookie layer)

The web client proves possession of a bearer token once; the server exchanges
it for an opaque session secret delivered as an **HttpOnly cookie**. The
browser app never holds a permanent token.

```http
POST /api/v1/session      # body {"token": "mpk_..."}  -> Set-Cookie
GET  /api/v1/session      # probe (authenticated)       -> {"status":"authenticated", ...}
DELETE /api/v1/session    # logout (public, idempotent) -> 204 + cleared cookie
```

- The exchange only succeeds for a currently-valid bearer token (`401`
  otherwise). Malformed JSON → `400 invalid_request`.
- The session secret is 256-bit random, base64url, and **only its SHA-256 is
  stored**, keyed to the underlying token's hash. A session therefore inherits
  the token's validity: revoking or expiring the token invalidates its
  sessions.
- Cookie attributes: `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict; Path=/; Max-Age=2592000`
  (30 days, sliding). `Secure` is added when the request arrived over HTTPS
  (`X-Forwarded-Proto: https` behind a reverse proxy) or when the server is
  started with `--secure-cookies`.
- CSRF is mitigated by `SameSite=Strict` (the only state-changing endpoints
  are scan/verify/session, and cross-site requests never carry the cookie).
- The auth middleware accepts `Authorization: Bearer` **or** the session
  cookie. Health and session create/logout are public.

## 0.3 CORS (Phase 6 notes)

`Access-Control-Allow-Methods` now includes `DELETE`; preflight responses set
`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` for explicitly allowed origins
(cross-site cookie use still requires `SameSite=None`-style handling, which
the server does not emit; cookie sessions are intended same-origin).

## 0.4 Live library maintenance

```http
POST /api/v1/library/scan        # rescan the library (one worker, idempotent)
POST /api/v1/library/verify      # full sha256 integrity check (one worker)
GET  /api/v1/library/status      # current/last scan + verify state
```

- A scan/verify runs on a single background worker over SQLite WAL; serving
  and API reads continue, and new state is visible after each package's
  commit. If a scan or verify is already running, a duplicate request returns
  `409 scan_already_running`.
- `GET /library/status` returns e.g.:

```json
{ "scan": { "running": false, "startedAt": "…", "finishedAt": "…",
            "packagesScanned": 124, "added": 2, "updated": 1,
            "removed": 0, "invalid": 0 },
  "verify": { "running": false, "packagesVerified": 124, "passed": 120,
              "warnings": 2, "failed": 2 } }
```

- Verification uses `.mpack` semantics (SHA-256 of every referenced object)
  and updates each package's `status`/`verify_status`. Nothing is hashed at
  startup.

## 1. Conventions

### Base path

All endpoints are under `/api/v1/`. The version prefix changes only on
incompatible API changes; additive extensions never change it.

### Identifiers

Resource ids are decimal integers (SQLite rowids) carried as JSON numbers.
Client-supplied ids are parsed **strictly**: only ASCII digits, at most 18
characters, value ≤ 2^63−1. Anything else is a `400 invalid_request`.

### Identifier lifetime

A public identifier remains stable across re-ingestion while the logical
entity remains the same. Metadata changes must never cause an entity to
receive a new public id:

- **Tracks and audio objects** keep their ids across scans when the track's
  audio content is unchanged. Identity follows audio content (the manifest's
  `sha256`), not position: renumbering a track or moving it between discs
  keeps its id; editing titles, loudness, artwork, or other metadata does
  too. A full library verification pass likewise preserves ids.
- **Assets** (artwork/booklet/lyrics/extras) keep their ids while their
  `(kind, role, path)` key remains in the manifest.
- **Albums (release groups), releases (editions), artists** keep their ids
  for as long as their identity keys match (`group_key`/`release_key`,
  artist name). Artist ids have always been stable in practice (artists
  are upserted, never deleted) and since Phase 2A may carry an optional
  MusicBrainz anchor; the anchor is an enrichment hint and never changes
  an artist id, nor any package/release identity.

Limits of the guarantee — a new id is issued exactly when an entity is
genuinely created or destroyed:

- removing an entry from a manifest deletes its rows (with them, their ids);
  re-adding it later yields fresh ids;
- replacing a track's audio file with different content (a different
  `sha256`) at the same position is treated as removal + creation;
- ambiguous situations are resolved conservatively: duplicate audio content
  within one package can only be matched positionally, never by content
  alone.

Clients should therefore treat ids as durable references (persisted queue
positions, deep links, caches keyed by track id), not as ephemeral values,
while still handling `404 not_found` gracefully after genuine removals.

### Methods

`GET`, `HEAD`, `POST` (library maintenance, session create) and `DELETE`
(session logout). Anything else is `405 unsupported_method`.

### Pagination

List endpoints support:

```
?limit=&offset=
```

- `limit` default 50, clamped to `1..200`
- `offset` default 0, clamped to `0..100000`
- responses include `limit`, `offset`, and `total`

List ordering is deterministic:

- `albums`: album artist (first artist), then title (case-insensitive), then
  original release date; `?sort=recent` reorders by scan/creation time
  descending
- `artists`: name (case-insensitive)
- nested `releases` within an album: release date, then id

### Search

`/albums` and `/artists` accept `?q=TEXT` (case-insensitive substring match on
title/artist-name; `%`/`_`/`\` in the query are treated literally).

### Errors

Every failure returns a consistent JSON envelope:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "not_found", "message": "Track not found" } }
```

| code                | HTTP  | meaning                                   |
|---------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------|
| `invalid_request`   | 400   | malformed id, pagination, or path         |
| `unauthorized`      | 401   | missing, invalid, expired or revoked token |
| `origin_forbidden`  | 403   | disallowed CORS origin                    |
| `not_found`         | 404   | unknown resource or endpoint              |
| `unsupported_method`| 405   | non-GET/HEAD/POST                         |
| `scan_already_running` | 409 | a scan or verify is already running      |
| `bad_range`         | 416   | unsatisfiable or malformed `Range`        |
| `unavailable`       | 503   | package/file missing or invalid           |
| `internal`          | 500   | server-side failure                       |

Raw SQLite/parser errors are never exposed to clients. Filesystem paths are
never returned in responses.

## 2. Resources

### `GET /api/v1/health`

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "schemaVersion": 1
}
```

### `GET /api/v1/albums`

List of release groups (albums). Collector model: editions are never merged.

```json
{
  "albums": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "title": "Example Album",
      "releaseType": "album",
      "originalReleaseDate": "1986-06-16",
      "artists": [ { "id": 1, "name": "Artist", "role": "main" } ],
      "releaseCount": 2,
      "artwork": { "id": 7, "url": "/api/v1/assets/7" }
    }
  ],
  "limit": 50, "offset": 0, "total": 1
}
```

`artwork` is the front cover of the album's earliest visible release (when any
release has one); it is omitted when the album has no artwork.

### `GET /api/v1/albums/{id}`

```json
{
  "album": {
    "id": 2, "title": "Example Album", "releaseType": "album",
    "originalReleaseDate": "1986-06-16",
    "artists": [ { "id": 1, "name": "Artist" } ]
  },
  "releases": [
    {
      "id": 10, "edition": "Original European CD", "releaseDate": "1986-06-16",
      "country": "DE", "label": "X", "catalogueNumber": "Y", "barcode": "…",
      "media": ["CD"], "trackCount": 12,
      "artwork": { "id": 7, "url": "/api/v1/assets/7" },
      "packageStatus": "valid", "verifyStatus": "unverified"
    }
  ]
}
```

`releases[]` shows the distinct editions; a client renders
`Album └── N versions`. `media` is the list of distinct medium formats
(`["CD"]`, `["CD", "Digital"]`, `["Digital"]`). `artwork` is the front cover
of that specific release (edition switching can swap covers without a second
request).

### `GET /api/v1/releases/{id}`

Full release/edition detail. Top-level release metadata mirrors `.mpack` v1's
optional `release` block (`edition`, `releaseDate`, `country`, `label`,
`catalogueNumber`, `notes`) when present. Release identifiers (`barcode` and
MusicBrainz release ID), `identity`, `source`, and `provenance` are separate
manifest fields. `packageStatus` and `verifyStatus` describe the package;
`album` carries the release-group summary and artists.

```json
{
  "id": 10,
  "edition": "2016 Remaster",
  "releaseDate": "2016-09-23",
  "album": { "id": 2, "title": "Example Album", "artists": [ ... ] },
  "loudness": { "algorithm": "ITU-R BS.1770-5",

          "artists": [ { "id": 1, "name": "Artist" } ],

            "streamVersion": 8, "sampleRate": 44100, "channels": 2
          },
          "audio": { "id": 90, "size": 28288, "sha256": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
                     "url": "/api/v1/tracks/55/audio" },
          "representations": [
            { "id": 91, "size": 184320, "sha256": "fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210",

              "codec": { "codec": "flac", "mimeType": "audio/flac", "sampleRate": 48000, "channels": 2 },
              "label": "FLAC 24/96" }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "artwork": [ { "id": 7, "kind": "artwork", "role": "front",
                 "mimeType": "image/jpeg", "sha256": "5335…d22ca",
                 "url": "/api/v1/assets/7" } ],
  "assets": [ { "id": 8, "kind": "booklet", "mimeType": "application/pdf",
                "url": "/api/v1/assets/8" } ],
  "packageStatus": "valid", "verifyStatus": "unverified"
}
```

Media and track arrays retain the package's canonical manifest order.
`loudness` carries the package's canonical album-level BS.1770-5 measurement
(stored from the manifest, never recomputed). Track `duration` is seconds from
the manifest when present. These power the client's Album/Track normalization
without inventing new package semantics.

**Content hashes (additive):** representation entries and release assets
(`artwork`/`assets`) carry an optional `sha256` — the same lowercase-hex
manifest hash the byte endpoints expose as their strong `ETag` — and
`waveform` objects carry `sha256` as well. Clients can verify downloaded
bytes without a separate `HEAD`; absent values are tolerated for forward/
backward compatibility with older servers.

### `GET /api/v1/tracks/{id}`

Track detail with a small `context` block (album/release/disc). Track
JSON includes an optional `waveform` field — `null` when the package has
no waveform envelope for the track, otherwise
`{ version, intervalMs, encoding, floorDb, points, url }`. See
`specs/musicpack-waveform-v1.md`.

### `GET /api/v1/tracks/{id}/audio`

Direct byte serving of the original contained audio object. See §3.

### `GET /api/v1/tracks/{id}/representations/{rid}/audio`

Direct byte serving of one **alternate audio representation** of the track
(Phase 3). Track JSON lists them via the optional `representations` array
(`{ id, size, url, codec, label? }`, in manifest position order; the key is
omitted entirely when a track has none). The route inherits every serving
rule of `/tracks/{id}/audio`: authentication, `Range`/206/416 handling,
security headers, disposition. Its strong ETag is the **variant's own
content sha256** (variants are immutable content; the manifest hash is
updated in place when content changes). A `{rid}` that does not belong to
`{id}`, or whose owning package is not servable, returns 404.
Representation ids follow the same identifier-lifetime rules as other
entities: stable across rescans while `(track, path)` is unchanged; changing
a representation's path issues a new id. Clients may select among the
listed representations (e.g. by user preference); `audio` remains the
default for clients that do not, and selection is a client-side decision —
the serving contract above is identical for both.

### `GET /api/v1/tracks/{id}/waveform`

Direct byte serving of the track's precomputed waveform envelope
(`peak-rms-u8`, 2 bytes/bucket). Returns `404` when the track has no
waveform. Same authentication, ETag (`"<sha256>"`), `Cache-Control`,
security headers, and disposition behavior as `/audio`; the payload is
tiny (≤ 1.5 MiB per track, ~1.2 KB/minute of audio) and is consumed
whole, so `Range` is intentionally not supported. See
`specs/musicpack-waveform-v1.md` §12.

### `GET /api/v1/assets/{id}`

Controlled asset serving. Only artwork/booklet/lyrics assets are served
(`extras` are indexed but never exposed here). Asset paths always come from
the validated package model + containment resolution — callers can never
supply a filesystem path.

### `GET /api/v1/artists` / `GET /api/v1/artists/{id}`

Artist list (with `albumCount`) and artist detail (with `albums[]`).
Artist detail additionally carries the optional enrichment fields
`sortName` and `musicbrainzId`, each omitted entirely (never `null`) when
the library has no value for them. `musicbrainzId` is a reference for
external lookups only; it is not part of any identity key.

## 3. Direct streaming + HTTP Range

`/tracks/{id}/audio` and `/assets/{id}` serve the **original stored bytes**:
no decode, remux, re-encode, normalization or tag rewriting. Files are
streamed from an fd; never loaded into RAM.

- `200` full file, `Content-Length: <size>`, `Accept-Ranges: bytes`,
  `Content-Type: <mime>`
- `206 Partial Content` for a satisfiable single range
- `416 Range Not Satisfiable` for unsatisfiable or malformed ranges, with
  `Content-Range: bytes */<size>`

Single range syntax (RFC 9110 §14.2, "Range"), all supported:

```
Range: bytes=0-1023      first 1024 bytes
Range: bytes=1024-       open-ended
Range: bytes=-4096       last 4096 bytes (suffix)
```

Semantics:

- `bytes=0-0` on a non-empty file → 1 byte (206)
- an end beyond EOF is clamped to the file end
- a first-byte-pos ≥ size → 416
- `bytes=-N` with N > size → whole file (206)
- `bytes=-0`, non-`bytes` units, multiple ranges, or non-numeric bounds → 416
- range lengths/offsets are 64-bit

Responses:

```
206 Partial Content
Content-Range: bytes 0-1023/28288
Content-Length: 1024
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Type: audio/musepack
```

`HEAD` on audio/assets returns headers only (correct `Content-Length`,
`Accept-Ranges`, `Content-Type`), no body.

**Integrity guarantee:** the bytes served for a track hash to the `sha256`
recorded for that audio object in the `.mpack` manifest.

### Validators and caching

Audio/assets expose a **strong `ETag`** equal to the manifest `sha256`
(e.g. `ETag: "842a…c6e8"`). `If-None-Match` with a matching validator returns
`304 Not Modified` (taking precedence over `Range` per RFC 9110 §13.1.1).
Responses carry `Cache-Control: private, max-age=0, must-revalidate` — package
bytes can change on a rescan, so content is revalidated rather than marked
immutable. API JSON responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`.

## 4. MIME / codec semantics

MIME type is presentation; the codec string is the application's identity for
a stream. Both are derived server-side from the object path/stream — never
from manifest claims.

| extension | MIME                    | codec            |
|-----------|-------------------------|------------------|
| `.mpc`    | `audio/musepack`        | `musepack-sv8` / `musepack-sv7` (probed) |
| `.flac`   | `audio/flac`            | `flac`           |
| `.wav`    | `audio/wav`             | `wav`            |
| `.ogg`    | `audio/ogg`             | `vorbis`         |
| `.jpg/.jpeg/.png/.gif/.webp/.bmp` | `image/*` | — |
| `.pdf`    | `application/pdf`       | —                |
| `.lrc/.txt/.md` | `text/plain`      | —                |
| other     | `application/octet-stream` | `unknown`     |

`sampleRate`, `channels`, and `streamVersion` are probed from headers at scan
time (libmusepack for Musepack; FLAC STREAMINFO). `duration` comes from the
manifest (derived, not canonical).

## 5. Versioning rules

- The URL prefix (`/api/v1/`) is the API version; bump on incompatible change.
- Fields are added, never removed/renamed, within a version.
- The `.mpack` manifest schema version (`specs/musicpack-v1.md`) is
  independent of the API version.
- A server may support multiple API versions concurrently.

## 6. Concurrency

- The server runs a single MHD event-loop thread; request handlers need no
  locks. SQLite is WAL mode with a 5 s busy timeout.
- Concurrent streams and API reads are safe; each request has independent
  file/object state.
- `musicpack-server scan` may run while the server is serving; WAL allows the
  reader to pick up committed changes. In-process rescan is intentionally not
  implemented in Phase 4.

## 7. Security posture

- Loopback binding by default; never auto-exposes remote access.
- No arbitrary-path endpoints; serving only from DB ids + containment-checked
  package paths (realpath, no `..`, no symlink escape).
- Strict numeric parsing for ids and ranges; bounded paths/pagination;
  connection limits, per-IP limits and idle timeouts on the server.
- Tokens: 256-bit CSPRNG secrets, only SHA-256 stored, constant-time
  verification, revocable, never logged. Sessions: the same model over the
  token hash; session secrets are HttpOnly cookies, only SHA-256 stored, and
  inherit token revocation/expiry.
- `extras/` is indexed but not served; the static directory
  (`--static-dir`) serves only files under that directory and is never backed
  by library packages. Unknown extension-less GET paths under the static
  directory fall back to `index.html` (SPA deep links); `/api/` is never
  routed to the static handler, and asset paths with an extension still 404.
- The static directory is served with `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy:
  same-origin` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`
  (cross-origin isolation for the SharedArrayBuffer reader).
- The first-party web client is served from the server's origin and carries a
  Content-Security-Policy in its own `index.html`; the server does not emit
  `unsafe-*` directives.
- Deployment: Phase 5 is local/trusted-network; for remote access put the
  server behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy or tunnel (the server stays
  privately bound). No TLS is implemented by the server itself.
