/*
  Migration 1: the Phase 4 library schema.

  Collector hierarchy (frozen .mpack v1 semantics preserved, never flattened):

    release_groups (album)  -> releases (specific edition) -> media (disc)
                                                            -> tracks
    group_artists / track_artists   -> artists (normalized)
    tracks 1:1 audio_objects        (codec/size/sha, streaming source)
    releases 1:N assets             (artwork/booklet/lyrics)
    packages -> releases            (where a release is stored on disk)

  Identity strategy (see identity.h): packages carry a content fingerprint
  (sha256 of the canonical manifest) used for change + move detection; groups
  and releases carry stable keys so moving a package does not change its
  logical identity. status values follow musicpack verify semantics plus a
  server-side 'invalid' for manifest parse failures.
