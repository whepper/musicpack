/// Filesystem paths are NOT the conceptual identity of a release. Three
/// levels are computed server-side (nothing is added to .mpack v1):
///
///  - package fingerprint: sha256 of the canonical manifest serialization.
///    Any content change (including audio sha256 in the manifest) yields a
///    new fingerprint; a moved package keeps its fingerprint, so a package
///    reappearing at a new path is recognised as the same package.
///  - group key: MusicBrainz release-group id when present, else a hash of
///    the stable group fields (title, sorted artists, original date, type).
///    Distinct editions group into the same release group.
///  - release key: MusicBrainz release id when present, else a hash of the
///    edition-distinguishing fields (edition, date, country, label,
///    catalogue, barcode) within the group.
