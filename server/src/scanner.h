/// \file scanner.h
/// Library scanner: finds `.mpack` directory bundles under a root, validates
/// them through libmusicpack, and upserts the collector library.
///
/// Behavior:
///  - recursion stops at a `.mpack` directory (the package root);
///  - symlinks are never followed during traversal;
///  - the manifest file's sha256 is the cheap change detector (unchanged
///    packages are skipped without reopening);
///  - a package reappearing at a new path with the same content fingerprint
///    is a move, not a new album;
///  - each package is ingested in its own transaction, so a malformed
///    package never corrupts the index;
///  - packages absent from the filesystem are marked unavailable.
