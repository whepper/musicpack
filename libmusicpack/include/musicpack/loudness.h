/// \file loudness.h
/// BS.1770-only loudness model and measurement.
///
/// The `.mpack` canonical loudness metadata is measured with **ITU-R
/// BS.1770-5** (K-weighted, gated integrated loudness and true peak).
/// ReplayGain values read from `.mpc` are import-time compatibility data,
/// never canonical MusicPack metadata. Gain is derived, not stored: see
/// musicpack_loudness_compute_gain().
///
/// What MusicPack implements (BS.1770-5):
///   - integrated loudness: K-weighting, 400 ms blocks, -70 LU absolute gate
///     and -10 LU relative gate (the standard program-loudness algorithm);
///   - true peak: 4x-oversampled (49-tap sinc) interpolated peak per channel,
///     floors at -70 dBTP.
/// Not stored: loudness range (LRA) and channel configurations above stereo
/// (BS.1770-5's multichannel additions); stereo/mono results are identical to
/// BS.1770-4.
