# libmusepack WASM playback demo

A minimal proof-of-concept that plays a `.mpc` file in the browser:

```text
.mpc bytes
    ↓
libmusepack.wasm (decoder core + wrapper, in a Worker)
    ↓
decoded float PCM (message chunks)
    ↓
Web Audio (AudioBufferSourceNodes)
    ↓
audible playback
```

Decoding runs off the UI thread in `worker.js`. The main thread forwards PCM
to a `PcmSink`; the active sink uses `AudioBufferSourceNode`s (the approved
first proof-of-concept path). The intended production architecture — worker
decoder → `AudioWorkletNode` — is sketched in `audio-worklet.js` and needs no
changes to the worker's message protocol.

## Build the WASM module

Requires [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) (`emcc`/`emcmake` on PATH).

```sh
./build.sh
```

This configures and builds the decoder for wasm and copies `musepack.js` +
`musepack.wasm` into this directory. (Those two generated files are
gitignored.)

Alternatively build manually and copy:

```sh
emcmake cmake -S .. -B ../build-wasm
cmake --build ../build-wasm --target musepack_wasm -j
cp ../build-wasm/wasm/musepack.js ../build-wasm/wasm/musepack.wasm .
```

## Run

Serve the demo over HTTP (fetch of the `.wasm` binary needs a server; a plain
`file://` open will not work):

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or: npx serve .
```

Then open http://localhost:8000/, choose a `.mpc` file, press Play.

No encoder fixtures ship with the demo; encode any WAV first with the native
`mpcenc` tool (e.g. `mpcenc in.wav out.mpc`), or pick an existing SV8 `.mpc`.

## What it exercises

- module init and fixture open
- stream info (sample rate, channels, length)
- chunked decode off the UI thread
- play / pause / stop
- seeking (scrubber + seek button)
- playback position readout
- end-of-stream handling (replays from the start on Play)

## Streaming from a musicpack-server (Phase 5)

The demo can play a Musepack track served by `musicpack-server` using the
**demand-driven range reader**:

```text
musicpack-server
     ↓  HTTP Range (206), only the blocks the decoder asks for
network Worker (block cache + fetch + Bearer auth)
     ↓  SharedArrayBuffer + Atomics (two-flag REQ/RES handshake)
libmusepack.wasm (mpc_wasm_open_range)
     ↓  PCM
Web Audio
```

Enter the server URL and an API token, press "Load albums", pick a track,
Play. The decoder requests only the compressed ranges it needs: playback
starts before the whole file is downloaded, and seeking (e.g. to 90%) fetches
just the new block(s). Bytes are never transcoded or rewritten; the served
file is the original `.mpc`.

Requirements:

- Serve the demo with the Phase 5 server's `--static-dir` (it sends
  `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` + `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy:
  require-corp`, which the `SharedArrayBuffer` reader needs).
- Enter an API token; it is kept in memory only and sent as
  `Authorization: Bearer` on every request (including range fetches).

Network failures (timeouts, 401, 404/503, truncated 206, missing
Content-Range, unexpected 200) surface as a clear playback error rather than
corrupted audio. The `wasm/smoke.js` suite exercises the reader in Node
(including a seek-to-90% fetch-accounting check and failure injection).

## Intended architecture (next step)

```text
browser UI  →  Worker (decode)  →  AudioWorklet (playback)  →  speakers
```

The `AudioWorkletSink` stub in `main.js` and the processor in
`audio-worklet.js` mark where that lands; the worker stays a pure decoder.

## MPAK containers over HTTP Range (browser/WASM)

`demo/mpakrange.js` acquires a remote `.mpak` container over validated
HTTP Range requests (256 KiB discovery, 64 KiB blocks, 206/Content-Range
checks, ETag/If-Range, no content-encoding) and installs the synchronous
imports behind `wasm/mpak_wasm.c`'s `mpak_wasm_open_range()` — the MPAK
core then runs unchanged inside the WASM module (open/verify/decode/seek
over the range source). Acquisition is bounded (`maxBytes`, default
2 GiB), multipart responses are rejected, and the WASM imports enforce
one-active-source-per-Module. See specs/mpak-http-range-design.md for the
transport contract and browser limitations (CORS preflight for If-Range,
acquire-then-serve execution model).
