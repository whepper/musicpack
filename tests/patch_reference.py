"""Patch the pristine reference CMakeLists so only the encoder builds.

The upstream r475 build tree (git 05d97a5) cannot configure on a modern
CI runner without help:

  * mpcgain/mpcchap require libreplaygain/libcuefile and hard-fail when
    they are absent;
  * mpcdec, mpc2sv8, mpccut (and wavcmp) declare add_executable twice
    under if(MSVC), which CMake rejects as duplicate targets on Windows;
  * the encoder only needs libmpcpsy, libmpcenc and include.

Commenting out the other subdirectories keeps configure green everywhere
while leaving the mpcenc target (and its static-lib dependencies) intact.

Usage: patch_reference.py <reference-source-dir>
